  <h1>Support for Carers</h1>
  <p class="lead">Caring for someone you love can be one of the most meaningful things you’ll ever do — but it can also feel overwhelming, lonely, and exhausting. You are not alone, and you deserve care too. This page explores the emotions carers often face, how to look after yourself, and where to find extra help when it feels too much.</p>

    <h2>Anticipatory Grief</h2>
    <p>When you’re looking after someone with a life-limiting illness or progressive condition, it’s normal to grieve *before* the person has gone. This doesn’t mean you love them any less — it means you’re human, and you’re already preparing emotionally for the change ahead.</p>
    <p>You might notice waves of sadness, anger, or even guilt when you find yourself wishing for a break. These feelings are valid and common. Naming them can take away some of their weight.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Grief After Loss</h2>
    <p>When your caring role ends, you may feel both devastation and relief. Both can coexist — you can miss the person deeply while also feeling lighter because the strain of caring has eased. Allowing both feelings to be present is part of healthy grieving.</p>
    <p>Some carers also feel a sudden loss of identity — if caring has been your focus for months or years, it can be hard to know who you are without it. Finding new routines, connections, and gentle goals can help you rebuild.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Carer Burnout</h2>
    <p>Exhaustion, short temper, trouble sleeping, and a constant feeling of “running on empty” can all be signs of carer burnout. Looking after someone round the clock often means putting your own needs last — but without refuelling, you’ll eventually run out of energy.</p>
    <p>Even small changes matter: a ten-minute walk, a call with a friend, or a proper meal instead of biscuits on the go. Think of these not as luxuries, but as essential maintenance for your health.</p>

    <h2>Self-Care for Carers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ask for help:</strong> Even one hour of respite can make a difference. Reach out to family, friends, or carer services.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep a small ritual:</strong> A morning coffee in the garden, writing one sentence in a journal, or listening to music. Tiny moments can keep you grounded.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay connected:</strong> Isolation is one of the hardest parts of caring. Online groups and local carer cafes can remind you you’re not the only one going through this.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Grief: Understanding, Living With, and Finding Support</h1>
  <p class="lead">Grief is love turned inside out. It is messy, powerful, and utterly human. There is no “right” way to grieve, and no timetable that fits everyone. Here, we’ll explore the many forms grief can take, why they affect us so deeply, and where to find support.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Bereavement</h2>
    <p>This is the grief most people think of — losing someone to death. It can bring waves of sadness, anger, guilt, or even relief, depending on the relationship and the circumstances.</p>
    <p>Bereavement grief often comes in unexpected moments: a song on the radio, a smell in the kitchen, or seeing their chair left empty. These everyday triggers can feel like reopening the wound.</p>

    </figure>
    <p><em>Affirmation:</em> “I can honour them by remembering, not by erasing.”</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Anticipatory Grief</h2>
    <p>When someone is approaching the end of life — through illness or age — grief can begin before death itself. You might find yourself grieving in advance, feeling sadness and loss even while they are still here.</p>
    <p>This can be confusing: one moment you’re laughing with them, the next you’re mourning a future without them. Both are valid. Anticipatory grief is your heart preparing for what’s to come.</p>

      <figcaption class="cap">Anticipatory grief often mingles love, hope, and sorrow together.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Affirmation:</em> “I can love them fully now, even as I prepare to let go.”</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Complicated Grief</h2>
    <p>Sometimes grief doesn’t soften over time. Instead, it remains intense, overwhelming, and can interfere with daily life. This is called complicated grief, or prolonged grief disorder.</p>
    <p>It can feel like being trapped in a loop — unable to accept the loss, replaying memories constantly, or avoiding reminders altogether. If this is your experience, it’s not a failure on your part. It’s a signal that more support may be needed.</p>
    <p>Professional grief counselling or therapy can help untangle these knots. You deserve that help.</p>
    <p><em>Affirmation:</em> “Needing support does not mean I am weak. It means my love runs deep.”</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Child and Infant Loss</h2>
    <p>The death of a child is a grief that feels against nature. Whether during pregnancy, infancy, or later childhood, the impact is immense. Parents often carry guilt, unanswered questions, and a sense of isolation — “no one can understand this pain.”</p>
    <p>Every tiny milestone not reached becomes a reminder: birthdays, first days at school, imagined futures. The grief is not only for who they were, but for who they should have been.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Living Losses</h2>
    <p>Grief is not always about death. You can grieve a divorce, the end of a friendship, the loss of health, a job, a home, or even your sense of identity. These “living losses” can feel less acknowledged by others, but they are no less real.</p>
    <p>One of the hardest parts is that the world around you often expects you to “move on” quickly. Yet, living losses can linger quietly and affect confidence, self-worth, and mental health.</p>

    <p><em>Affirmation:</em> “I can grieve what was, while still shaping what will be.”</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Grief Affects Us So Deeply</h2>
    <p>Grief isn’t just emotional — it’s physical. Brain scans show grief lighting up the same pain circuits as a broken bone. That’s why your chest may ache, your stomach churn, or your body feel heavy. It’s the nervous system responding to loss.</p>
    <p>Depression and anxiety often overlap with grief. You may feel numb, unable to sleep, or like your thoughts won’t stop racing. These are normal responses, not personal failings.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Finding Support</h2>
    <p>While grief is natural, you do not have to carry it alone. Support groups, helplines, and counselling can give you space to share, to breathe, and to feel understood.</p>

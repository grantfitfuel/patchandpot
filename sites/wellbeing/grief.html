  <h1>Understanding Grief</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Grief isn’t something to “get over.” It’s love trying to find a new shape. If you feel foggy,
    overwhelmed, numb, angry, guilty, or suddenly okay and then not — you’re not broken, you’re human.
    This page explains grief in everyday language and points you to real help.

  <section id="types">
    <h2>1. Types of Grief</h2>
    <p>Grief has many shapes. You might recognise more than one, or move between them over time.</p>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Anticipatory grief</h3>
      <p>
        Begins before a death or major loss (e.g., terminal illness, dementia). You grieve “little losses” —
        changes in memory, roles, or independence — while still showing up with love. Mixed feelings (sadness,
        tenderness, guilt, relief) are normal.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Complicated / prolonged grief</h3>
      <p>
        Grief that stays intense and disruptive for a long time. It’s more common after sudden or traumatic loss
        or when there were unresolved conflicts. Signs include persistent yearning, feeling life can’t move
        forward, or avoiding reminders. Specialist support can really help.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Disenfranchised grief</h3>
      <p>
        Pain that isn’t recognised by others — miscarriage, suicide, pet loss, estrangement, ending a
        relationship. The loss is real, but validation is missing. Finding people who “get it” lightens the load.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Collective grief</h3>
      <p>
        Communities grieving together after disaster, pandemics, or public tragedies. It can feel heavy and
        strangely unifying at once.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Secondary losses</h3>
      <p>
        We grieve routines, roles, places, and identity (e.g., “the person who made me feel like someone’s
        child”). These hidden losses often explain why grief returns in waves.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Childhood grief</h3>
      <p>
        Children grieve in bursts — playing one moment, deeply sad the next. Repeating questions and changes in
        behaviour are common. Gentle honesty and steady presence matter more than perfect words.

  <section id="why-overwhelming">
    <h2>2. Why Grief Feels Overwhelming</h2>
    <p>Grief affects the whole body, not just emotions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brain fog:</strong> forgetfulness, poor focus, feeling “spaced out”.</li>
      <li><strong>Body load:</strong> heavy tiredness, aches, disrupted sleep and appetite.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional waves:</strong> sadness, anger, guilt, relief, numbness — all can be normal.</li>
      <li><strong>Social strain:</strong> feeling out of step with others, withdrawing, not wanting to explain.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="sarah">
    <h2>3. Sarah’s Story</h2>
    <p><em>
      “When my mum died, I thought I had to ‘be strong’ and go back to normal fast. But normal had changed.
      Some days I forgot to eat; other days I laughed at tiny things and then felt guilty. I thought I was
      doing grief wrong until a support group told me: ‘Everyone’s rhythm is different.’ It didn’t fix the pain,
      but it let me breathe.”
    </em></p>
    <p>
      Stories like Sarah’s remind us there’s no timetable. If your grief looks different to someone else’s,
      that’s okay.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="anxiety-depression">
    <h2>4. Anxiety &amp; Depression in Grief</h2>
    <p>
      Grief and mental health often overlap. Anxiety can make you restless, fearful of the future, or flooded by
      “what ifs.” Depression can bring emptiness, loss of motivation, or hopeless thoughts. These experiences
      don’t mean you’re failing at grief — they signal that your brain and body are under strain and might need
      extra support.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anxiety or depression makes daily life unmanageable for weeks, or you’re having thoughts of not wanting
      to be here, please reach out for professional help or a helpline listed below.

    <h2>5. What Helps Day-to-Day</h2>
    <div class="teaser-tiles">
      <div class="tile"><span class="cap"><strong>Tiny routines</strong><br>Anchor the day with one repeatable act (cup of tea outside, short walk, water a plant). Predictability soothes.</span></div>

      <div class="tile"><span class="cap"><strong>Names &amp; dates</strong><br>Say their name. Mark “griefy” days gently. Plan support around anniversaries.</span></div>
      <div class="tile"><span class="cap"><strong>Permission</strong><br>You can cry, laugh, be angry, be numb. Wave, not ladder.</span></div>

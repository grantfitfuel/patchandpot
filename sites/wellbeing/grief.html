  <h1>Understanding Grief</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Grief is not a problem to be solved. It’s a natural, painful, deeply human response to loss.
    If you feel foggy, overwhelmed, numb, angry, guilty — or okay and then suddenly not — you’re not broken;
    you’re grieving. This page offers clear explanations, lived examples, and practical support — with no judgement
    and plenty of kindness.

  <!-- 1. Types of grief -->
  <section id="types">
    <h2>1. Types of Grief</h2>
    <p>
      Grief has many shapes. Naming them helps normalise what you’re feeling and reduces the shame of thinking
      you’re “doing it wrong.” Most people move between several types over time.
    </p>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Anticipatory grief</h3>
      <p>
        Grieving before a death or major change (for example, a loved one’s terminal illness or the slow decline of dementia).
        It’s the grief of waiting and losing small pieces at a time. Feeling guilty for grieving “too soon” or feeling relieved
        when the final moment comes are both common and human.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> A carer watching their partner lose memories feels sorrow at each forgotten detail — even while their partner is still there.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Complicated / prolonged grief</h3>
      <p>
        For some, the pain stays raw and all-consuming for a long time, especially after sudden or traumatic loss.
        Signs include persistent yearning, an inability to imagine a future, or avoiding reminders entirely.
        This isn’t failure — it’s grief frozen by trauma. Specialist bereavement support can help.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> A parent who lost a child avoids the accident route for years because the wound still feels fresh.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Disenfranchised grief</h3>
      <p>
        Grief that isn’t publicly recognised — miscarriage, pet bereavement, the death of an ex-partner, or the end of a friendship.
        Lack of acknowledgement can deepen the pain because usual support rituals aren’t offered. Your grief is valid, even if others don’t see it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> After a miscarriage, hearing “at least you can try again” can feel invalidating and isolating.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Collective grief</h3>
      <p>
        Communities grieve together after disasters, wars, pandemics, or national events. Collective grief can stir up older losses
        and also create solidarity — a reminder that sorrow is shared and survivable.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> During the pandemic, many grieved lost routines and milestones as well as people.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Secondary losses</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond the person, you may lose routines, roles, financial stability, and identity. These “secondary” losses explain why grief can return in waves,
        months or years later, as new parts of life are felt as missing.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> After losing a spouse, someone also grieves Sunday rituals or the comfort of being introduced as “a couple.”</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Childhood grief</h3>
      <p>
        Children grieve in bursts — cycling between tears and play. They revisit grief as they grow and understand more.
        Honest, age-appropriate language, reassurance of safety, and patience are key.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> A 7-year-old cries at bedtime but seems fine in the morning. This switching isn’t “moving on”; it’s how kids process.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Ambiguous grief</h3>
      <p>
        The person remains alive but is profoundly changed (addiction, severe mental illness, brain injury, advanced dementia).
        You grieve the relationship you had while still seeing the person often.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> “It feels like I’ve lost them twice.”</p>

  <!-- 2. Why grief feels overwhelming -->
  <section id="why-overwhelming">
    <h2>2. Why Grief Feels Overwhelming</h2>
    <p>Grief is whole-body. The brain, nervous system, and relationships all change at once.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brain fog &amp; memory slips:</strong> your attention system is overloaded; forgetting things is common.</li>
      <li><strong>Body reactions:</strong> fatigue, heavy chest, disrupted sleep, digestive changes — grief is physical.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional waves:</strong> anger, guilt, sadness, numbness, even laughter — all can coexist.</li>
      <li><strong>Social shifts:</strong> feeling “out of step” or misunderstood can lead to withdrawing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="meta">None of these mean you’re failing. They mean your brain is trying to adapt to a huge change.</p>

  <!-- 3. Sarah's story -->
  <section id="sarah">
    <h2>3. Sarah’s Story</h2>
    <p><em>
      “When my mum died, I thought I had to ‘be strong’ and go back to normal fast. But normal had changed.
      Some days I forgot to eat; other days I laughed at tiny things and then felt guilty. I thought I was
      doing grief wrong until a support group told me: ‘Everyone’s rhythm is different.’ It didn’t fix the pain,
      but it let me breathe.”
    </em></p>
    <p>Stories like Sarah’s remind us: grief doesn’t follow rules. Your way is valid.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. Anxiety & Depression -->
  <section id="anxiety-depression">
    <h2>4. Anxiety &amp; Depression in Grief</h2>
    <p>
      Anxiety can bring restlessness, fear, and “what if” spirals. Depression can bring emptiness, hopelessness,
      and a loss of motivation. These aren’t weakness — they’re overload. If thoughts of self-harm appear or daily life
      becomes unmanageable, it’s time for extra support.

    <h2>6. Rituals &amp; Continuing Bonds</h2>
    <p>
      Many people find comfort in an ongoing connection with the person who died. This isn’t “not moving on” — it’s healthy integration.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write letters to them on hard days or anniversaries.</li>
      <li>Cook their favourite meal or play their song on Sundays.</li>
      <li>Create a small corner with a photo, plant, or candle.</li>

    <h2>7. Anniversaries &amp; Triggers Plan</h2>
    <p>Heavy dates and surprise reminders are normal. A light plan helps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lower the bar:</strong> keep the day simple; cancel non-essential tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Company or quiet:</strong> choose what you need <em>this year</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Small ritual:</strong> visit a place, cook a dish, light a candle, or write a note.</li>
      <li><strong>Exit plan:</strong> if an event gets hard, have a pre-agreed “leave early” signal.</li>

      <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> routines and visual plans reduce anxiety.</li>

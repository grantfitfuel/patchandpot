  <h1>Understanding and Coping with Grief</h1>
  <p class="lead">Grief is the natural response to loss. It is not just about death — it can follow illness, separation, trauma, or life changes. Everyone grieves differently, but you are not alone. Below you will find an exploration of different types of grief, coping strategies, and links to trusted organisations.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Why Grief Feels Overwhelming</h2>
    <p>Grief affects the body and mind. You may experience sadness, anger, guilt, relief, or numbness. Physically, you might feel exhausted, restless, or even ill. Anxiety and depression are also common companions of grief, particularly when loss feels sudden or traumatic.</p>
    <p>Grief doesn’t follow neat “stages.” Instead, it comes in waves, with moments of calm and sudden surges of pain. This is normal, even if it feels confusing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Types of Grief</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anticipatory grief:</strong> Felt before a loss, often when caring for someone with a terminal illness.</li>
      <li><strong>Bereavement:</strong> The death of a loved one — whether sudden or expected.</li>
      <li><strong>Complicated grief:</strong> When grief feels stuck, overwhelming, or prolonged.</li>
      <li><strong>Traumatic grief:</strong> Loss connected with violence, accidents, or disaster.</li>
      <li><strong>Child loss:</strong> The death of a child, at any stage, is among the most painful experiences.</li>
      <li><strong>Loss of identity or role:</strong> Such as redundancy, retirement, or moving away from community.</li>
      <li><strong>Carer’s grief:</strong> The mixture of grief before, during, and after the loss of the person you cared for.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each type of grief brings unique challenges, but none should be faced without support.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Coping Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow yourself to feel — avoiding emotion can delay healing.</li>
      <li>Maintain small routines (meals, walks, watering plants) to give structure.</li>
      <li>Use grounding techniques: slow breathing, naming 5 things you can see.</li>
      <li>Connect with others — isolation can intensify grief.</li>
      <li>Seek professional support if emotions feel unmanageable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Living Alongside Grief</h2>
    <p>Grief doesn’t end — it changes shape. Over time, most people find that moments of joy and hope return, even as love and longing remain. Carrying grief does not mean forgetting; it means finding ways to live with memory and love alongside your present life.</p>

  <h1>Understanding Grief</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Grief is not a problem to be solved. It is a natural, painful, and deeply human response to loss.
    If you feel foggy, overwhelmed, numb, angry, guilty, or suddenly okay and then not — you’re not broken,
    you’re grieving. This page offers clear explanations, lived examples, and practical support.

    <h2>1. Types of Grief</h2>
    <p>
      Grief has many different shapes. Naming them helps normalise what you’re feeling and reduces the shame of thinking you’re “doing it wrong.” 
      Many people move between these types or experience several at once.
    </p>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Anticipatory grief</h3>
      <p>
        Anticipatory grief begins before a death or major change — for example, during a loved one’s terminal illness or the slow decline of dementia.
        It is the grief of waiting, of losing small pieces at a time. People often report feeling guilty for grieving “too soon” or relieved when the final moment comes. 
        Both are normal. Anticipatory grief is the mind’s way of preparing itself for the inevitable.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> A carer watching their partner slowly lose memories may feel waves of sorrow for each forgotten detail — even while their partner is still physically present.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Complicated or prolonged grief</h3>
      <p>
        Most grief softens slowly over time. But for some, the pain remains raw and all-consuming for years. This is called complicated grief.
        It often follows sudden, violent, or traumatic losses. Signs include persistent yearning, inability to imagine a future, or avoiding reminders entirely.
        Complicated grief is not a failure — it’s grief that has been frozen by trauma, and it often needs extra support such as specialist counselling.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> A parent who lost a child in an accident might avoid the road where it happened for decades, because the wound still feels fresh.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Disenfranchised grief</h3>
      <p>
        Disenfranchised grief is pain that society doesn’t openly recognise or validate. Losses such as miscarriage, pet bereavement, the death of an ex-partner, or the end of a long friendship may not be acknowledged publicly, leaving people isolated.
        This type of grief can cut especially deep because it comes without the support rituals (funerals, cards, community recognition) that accompany other losses.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> Someone grieving a miscarriage may feel dismissed if others say “at least you can try again.” This invalidation makes the grief heavier, not lighter.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Collective grief</h3>
      <p>
        Collective grief is shared grief — when communities mourn together after tragedies such as natural disasters, wars, pandemics, or national events.
        It may be less personal, yet it still affects our emotional world, often stirring up older personal griefs. 
        Collective grief can also foster solidarity and resilience, showing us we are not alone in our sorrow.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people felt grief not only for lost lives but also for lost routines, missed milestones, and shared safety.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Secondary losses</h3>
      <p>
        When someone dies, we lose more than just the person. We lose routines, roles, financial security, and parts of our identity.
        These are called secondary losses, and they often surface gradually. Recognising them can explain why grief comes back in waves months or years later.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> After losing a spouse, someone may grieve not just the partner but also the shared routines like Sunday shopping or being introduced as “a couple.”</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Childhood grief</h3>
      <p>
        Children grieve differently from adults. They may not sustain sadness for long periods, cycling instead between play and tears. 
        They often ask the same questions repeatedly, trying to make sense of permanence. Supporting a grieving child involves honesty at their level, reassurance of safety, and patience.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> A 7-year-old who loses a grandparent might cry at bedtime but appear cheerful in the morning — not because they’ve “moved on,” but because children process grief in bursts.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Ambiguous grief</h3>
      <p>
        Ambiguous grief happens when the person is still alive but fundamentally changed — for example, through addiction, mental illness, or brain injury. 
        You grieve the relationship you once had, even while still seeing the person daily.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Everyday example:</strong> A family with a loved one affected by advanced dementia may feel like they’ve “lost them twice.”</p>

  <section id="why-overwhelming">
    <h2>2. Why Grief Feels Overwhelming</h2>
    <p>Grief impacts the brain, body, and relationships all at once:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brain fog:</strong> difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and confusion are the brain’s way of processing overload.</li>
      <li><strong>Body response:</strong> fatigue, tight chest, sleep disruption, or even flu-like symptoms can appear because grief is also physical stress.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional waves:</strong> anger, guilt, sadness, numbness, even moments of joy — grief is not one feeling but a storm of many.</li>
      <li><strong>Social withdrawal:</strong> grief can make you feel “out of step,” leaving you unsure of how to engage with others.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="sarah">
    <h2>3. Sarah’s Story</h2>
    <p><em>
      “When my mum died, I thought I had to ‘be strong’ and go back to normal fast. But normal had changed.
      Some days I forgot to eat; other days I laughed at tiny things and then felt guilty. I thought I was
      doing grief wrong until a support group told me: ‘Everyone’s rhythm is different.’ It didn’t fix the pain,
      but it let me breathe.”
    </em></p>
    <p>Stories like Sarah’s remind us: grief doesn’t follow rules. Each story is valid.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="anxiety-depression">
    <h2>4. Anxiety &amp; Depression in Grief</h2>
    <p>
      Anxiety and depression often overlap with grief. Anxiety can make you feel restless, fearful, or flooded with “what if” thoughts. Depression can bring emptiness, loss of motivation, and hopelessness.
      These aren’t signs of weakness — they are signs of a brain and body in overload.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anxiety or depression becomes unmanageable or thoughts of self-harm appear, it’s a sign to seek urgent help. Helplines and professional services can help lighten the weight you’re carrying.

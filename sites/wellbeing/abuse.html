  <h1>Support for Those Experiencing Abuse</h1>
  <p class="lead">Abuse can take many forms — physical, emotional, psychological, financial, or coercive control. No one deserves to live in fear or under threat. This page provides explanation, support, and practical steps, alongside trusted links to organisations that can help.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Understanding Abuse</h2>
    <p>Abuse is about power and control. It can happen in relationships, families, or institutions. It may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physical abuse</strong>: hitting, pushing, restraining, or physical harm.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional/psychological abuse</strong>: insults, threats, manipulation, gaslighting.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial abuse</strong>: controlling money, denying access to finances, creating dependency.</li>
      <li><strong>Coercive control</strong>: isolating someone, monitoring daily activities, using intimidation.</li>
      <li><strong>Sexual abuse</strong>: any non-consensual sexual contact or pressure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Recognising abuse is the first step. It is not your fault.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Why It Feels So Hard to Leave</h2>
    <p>Abuse can make people feel trapped because of fear, financial dependency, social pressure, or the hope that things will improve. The psychological impact can include depression, anxiety, trauma responses, or feelings of guilt and shame. None of these mean you are weak — they are common reactions to being controlled and harmed.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you are reading this and feeling that leaving is impossible, please know there are safe ways to plan and people who understand what you are going through.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Steps You Can Take</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Talk to someone you trust:</strong> a friend, family member, or colleague who can listen without judgement.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact a helpline:</strong> confidential services are available 24/7.</li>
      <li><strong>Make a safety plan:</strong> keep important documents, medication, and emergency contacts in a safe place.</li>
      <li><strong>Use technology safely:</strong> clear browsing history, use a private device if possible.</li>
    </ul>

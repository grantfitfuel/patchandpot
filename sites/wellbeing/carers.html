  <h1>Carer Support</h1>
  <p class="lead">Caring for someone you love is both meaningful and exhausting. It can bring connection, but it can also bring burnout, grief, and isolation. You deserve support as much as the person you care for.</p>

  <section id="reality">
    <h2>The reality of being a carer</h2>
    <p>Carers often carry invisible weight. Common experiences include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anticipatory grief:</strong> grieving small changes or future loss long before it happens.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional exhaustion:</strong> always being “on call,” even at night.</li>
      <li><strong>Identity loss:</strong> forgetting who you are outside the caring role.</li>
      <li><strong>Guilt:</strong> for needing breaks, for feeling resentment, or for not being able to “fix” everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> friends and colleagues may not fully understand the daily reality.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="how-this-happens">
    <h2>Why caring takes such a toll</h2>
    <p>Caring places unique strain on the body and mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stress hormones:</strong> Constant vigilance keeps adrenaline and cortisol high, exhausting your system.</li>
      <li><strong>Sympathetic overdrive:</strong> Fight/flight activation makes it hard to relax or sleep deeply.</li>
      <li><strong>Parasympathetic shutdown:</strong> At times, exhaustion flips you into numbness or collapse — your system “pulls the brakes.”</li>
      <li><strong>Depression and anxiety:</strong> The unpredictability of illness, dementia, or decline can feed low mood, worry, and fear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These reactions are <em>normal human responses</em> to prolonged strain — not personal weakness.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="coping">
    <h2>Small coping tools</h2>
    <p>No tool fixes everything, but these can help you survive the harder days:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Micro-breaks:</strong> 60 seconds of fresh air or a glass of water count — your body notices.</li>
      <li><strong>Grounding exercise:</strong> Place your hand on your chest, breathe out slowly, and say: “I am safe in this moment.”</li>
      <li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> Saying “not now” to one small thing can save your energy for what matters most.</li>
      <li><strong>Connection:</strong> Even a short text to someone you trust can break the isolation.</li>
      <li><strong>Journaling:</strong> Writing down frustrations helps release them from your head onto paper.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

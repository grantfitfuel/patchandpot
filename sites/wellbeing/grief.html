  <h1>Grief: Understanding, Living With, and Finding Support</h1>
  <p class="lead">Grief is not a single feeling but a whole landscape of emotions, thoughts, and physical sensations. It can feel messy, unpredictable, and deeply exhausting — and yet, grief is a sign of love. This page offers explanations, everyday stories, and gentle tools to help you feel less alone.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>What Grief Can Feel Like</h2>
    <p>Grief doesn’t follow neat stages. One day you may feel a wave of sadness, the next a sense of numbness, and later still a burst of laughter that feels almost wrong. All of this is normal.</p>
    <p><strong>Everyday story:</strong> After losing her partner, Sarah found herself standing in the supermarket frozen in front of the bread aisle. She wasn’t just choosing food — she was facing the empty space at the table. That everyday moment felt heavier than the funeral.</p>

    <h2>Different Types of Grief</h2>

    <h3>Bereavement</h3>
    <p>The most recognised form, grief after the death of someone close. This can bring shock, sadness, anger, guilt, and longing.</p>

    <h3>Anticipatory Grief</h3>
    <p>This arises when someone you love is approaching the end of life — for example, living with a terminal illness. You may feel sadness before the loss has fully come.</p>

    <h3>Complicated Grief</h3>
    <p>Sometimes grief becomes prolonged, intense, and stuck, making it hard to function. This is also known as “prolonged grief disorder” and may benefit from professional help.</p>

    <h3>Child and Infant Loss</h3>
    <p>Losing a child brings a grief that feels unnatural and unbearable. Parents may struggle with guilt, questions, and isolation. Support exists specifically for this experience (see links below).</p>

    <h3>Living Losses</h3>
    <p>Grief isn’t only about death. It can come with the loss of health, a relationship, a home, or even identity. These losses can feel just as real and painful.</p>

    <p><em>Affirmation:</em> “My grief is mine, and it deserves space.”</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Grief Affects Us So Deeply</h2>
    <p>Grief activates the same brain circuits as physical pain. That’s why your chest can ache or your stomach can knot. Anxiety and depression often overlap with grief — racing thoughts, loss of motivation, exhaustion, or feeling numb are all common. You are not broken; you are human.</p>

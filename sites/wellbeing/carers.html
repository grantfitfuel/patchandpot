  <h1>Support for Carers</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Caring for someone you love can be one of the most meaningful things you’ll ever do — and also one of the most exhausting.
    If you’re running on empty, you’re not failing — you’re human. This page offers clear explanations, practical steps, and gentle
    permission to take up space too.

  <!-- WHAT YOU MAY BE FEELING -->
  <section id="feelings">
    <h2>What you may be feeling (and why that’s normal)</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Anticipatory grief</h3>
        <p>You may find yourself grieving before a loss has happened — especially with progressive conditions or serious illness. You’re not “giving up”; your brain is preparing for change. Naming it often eases the weight.</p>
        <ul class="meta">
          <li>Waves of sadness or anger</li>
          <li>Guilt for wanting a break</li>
          <li>Feeling split between love and exhaustion</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>After loss</h3>
        <p>When caring ends, people often feel both devastation and relief. Both can be true. Identity wobbles are common if caring shaped your days. Gentle routines, connection, and small goals help you rebuild.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Burnout</h3>
        <p>Snappy, foggy, running on adrenaline? That’s your nervous system stuck on “keep going”. Tiny refuels matter: a proper sandwich, a 10-minute walk, two quiet minutes with a tea.</p>
      </article>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- PRACTICAL CARE FOR YOU -->
  <section id="practical">
    <h2>Practical care for you (tiny steps that count)</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Micro-rests</h3>
        <p>Set a 2-minute timer. Shoulders down, slow your out-breath (in 4 — out 6). You’ve just signalled “safe” to your nervous system. Repeat often; it stacks.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/carers-breathing.png" alt="Calm still-life: warm tea and a breathing reminder card" style="border-radius:10px; width:100%; max-height:260px; object-fit:cover;">
          <figcaption class="cap">Small and often beats once and perfect.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Ask for help (script)</h3>
        <p><em>“Could you sit with Mum on Tuesday 2–4pm so I can do food shopping? I’ll leave her meds and the TV remote.”</em> Specific + time-boxed requests get more yeses.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Rituals that anchor</h3>
        <p>One small thing, same time daily: watering a plant, a cuppa in the doorway, a single journal sentence. Routines calm busy brains.</p>
      </article>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- PAPERWORK & APPOINTMENTS -->
  <section id="paperwork">
    <h2>Paperwork &amp; appointments (make admin lighter)</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>One-page hub</h3>
        <p>Keep a single page with the essentials: diagnosis, meds (dose/time), allergies, NHS/CHI number, GP/consultant contacts, next appointment. Photograph it so it’s on your phone too.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Bring a buddy</h3>
        <p>Two pairs of ears help. Ask the clinician if you can record a summary on your phone. Agree “one key question” before you go.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Scripts for clarity</h3>
        <p><em>“What’s the one thing you want me to watch for this week?”</em><br><em>“If X happens, who do I call?”</em></p>
      </article>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- COMMUNICATION & BOUNDARIES -->
  <section id="boundaries">
    <h2>Communication &amp; boundaries (protect your energy)</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Limits you can say out loud</h3>
        <p><em>“I can do evenings, but I can’t do nights.”</em> · <em>“I can manage meds; I can’t do heavy lifting.”</em></p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Family dynamics</h3>
        <p>Share roles with a simple rota. If someone can’t help in person, ask for admin tasks, calls, or funding a one-off cleaner.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Guilt vs capacity</h3>
        <p>Feeling guilty doesn’t mean you’re doing wrong. Check your <em>actual</em> capacity today, not your imagined one.</p>
      </article>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- MONEY, RIGHTS & RESPITE -->
  <section id="money">
    <h2>Money, rights &amp; respite (Scotland/UK)</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Carer’s assessment</h3>
        <p>Ask your local authority for a Carer’s (Adult Carer Support) Assessment. It looks at <em>your</em> needs and can unlock support or respite. Take a list of what’s hard on a typical week.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Benefits &amp; grants</h3>
        <ul class="meta">
          <li>Carer’s Allowance / Carer’s Allowance Supplement (eligibility applies)</li>
          <li>Young Carer Grant (Scotland)</li>
          <li>Local hardship/wellbeing funds or short breaks</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Respite options</h3>
        <p>Short breaks, sitting services, day centres. Even a few hours can reset your body and mind — it’s maintenance, not luxury.</p>
      </article>

  <!-- SPECIFIC CARING SITUATIONS -->
  <section id="situations">
    <h2>Specific caring situations</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Young carers</h3>
        <p>School, caring, and growing up is a lot. You deserve support, friends, and time to be young. Young carer services can help with advocacy, clubs, and grants.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Dementia</h3>
        <p>Routine, visual cues, and calm tone go a long way. Try dementia-friendly gardening: raised planters, strong-scent herbs, safe paths, and clear labels.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>End of life</h3>
        <p>Hospice teams focus on comfort — for the person and for you. It’s okay to ask: <em>“What should I expect tonight?”</em> · <em>“Who do I call if X happens?”</em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Create a “bad day” plan</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Text a safe person: “It’s a heavy day. Can you check in at 7?”</li>
          <li>Non-negotiables: water, snack, fresh air for 3 minutes</li>
          <li>Lower the bar: today’s win = one task</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Know the red flags</h3>
        <p>Not sleeping for days, thoughts of harming yourself, feeling you can’t keep someone safe — these are signals to get urgent support.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Quick grounding</h3>
        <p>5-4-3-2-1 senses, feet on floor, long exhale. You don’t need to “fix” everything right now; you just need this moment to pass.</p>

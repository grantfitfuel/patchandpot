  <h1>Carer Support</h1>
  <p class="lead">Caring for another person — whether a parent, partner, child, or friend — can be both rewarding and profoundly draining. It reshapes daily life, often without choice, and brings challenges that can affect every part of who you are. This page offers explanation, practical tools, and clear signposts to support.</p>

  <section id="lived-reality">
    <h2>The lived reality of caring</h2>
    <p>Carers often describe life as being “always on.” Even when you’re not physically doing tasks, your mind is alert, listening for a call, or worrying about the next stage of decline. Common experiences include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anticipatory grief:</strong> grieving changes and losses before they happen — such as a loved one’s fading memory or independence.</li>
      <li><strong>Role reversal:</strong> becoming the parent to your parent, or the organiser for a partner who once led.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional conflict:</strong> feeling love and resentment at the same time — then guilt for the resentment.</li>
      <li><strong>Hyper-vigilance:</strong> your nervous system on constant alert, unable to fully relax or rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Identity loss:</strong> your own hobbies, friendships, and career can feel as if they’ve disappeared.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="how-this-happens">
    <h2>Why caring takes such a toll</h2>
    <p>The strain of caring is not “just stress” — it’s a mix of physical, psychological, and neurological load:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sympathetic drive:</strong> fight-or-flight hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) keep you in a high-alert state, increasing fatigue and anxiety.</li>
      <li><strong>Parasympathetic collapse:</strong> after long overdrive, the body may “shut down” into numbness or apathy — often mistaken for laziness but actually protective exhaustion.</li>
      <li><strong>Depression risk:</strong> prolonged grief, isolation, and lack of control increase vulnerability to low mood and hopelessness.</li>
      <li><strong>Anxiety and overwhelm:</strong> uncertainty about the future or fear of “not doing enough” heightens worry and panic responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Complicated grief:</strong> caring for someone with dementia, terminal illness, or gradual decline can mean living in a cycle of loss before death arrives.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="coping">
    <h2>Practical tools that can help</h2>
    <p>No strategy removes the weight of caring, but small tools can make it less overwhelming:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anchor moments:</strong> set tiny, repeatable rituals just for you (tea outside at 10am, one song before bed). They give shape and sanity to days that blur together.</li>
      <li><strong>Micro-respite:</strong> even 5 minutes with headphones, a shower, or breathing space can reset your nervous system.</li>
      <li><strong>Body grounding:</strong> when overwhelmed, place your hand on a solid surface (table, wall), breathe out slowly, and notice three things you can see. This signals “safe enough” to the body.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared load:</strong> if family or friends offer help, give them something specific (“Could you sit for 30 minutes Tuesday?”). Vague “let me know if you need anything” rarely works.</li>
      <li><strong>Writing release:</strong> keeping a notebook for frustrations, hopes, or even a “swear page” helps unburden thoughts that otherwise repeat endlessly.</li>
      <li><strong>Accept imperfection:</strong> caring perfectly is impossible — “good enough” is already extraordinary.</li>
    </ul>

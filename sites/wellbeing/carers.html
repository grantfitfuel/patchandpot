  <h1>Carer Support</h1>
  <p class="lead">Caring for someone you love is an act of devotion — but it can also feel like carrying the weight of the world. This page explores why caring is so emotionally demanding, how it links with stress, anxiety and depression, and what you can do to protect your own wellbeing.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section>
    <h2>1. Why Caring Feels Overwhelming</h2>
    <p>Carers often carry an invisible load: constant responsibility, emotional strain, disrupted sleep, financial pressure, and the grief of watching someone decline. This mix can lead to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anxiety and overwhelm:</strong> Feeling constantly “on alert”, struggling to switch off or rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Low mood or depression:</strong> The sense that nothing will improve, or that you’re losing yourself in the role.</li>
      <li><strong>Guilt:</strong> Believing you should do more, even when you’re already at breaking point.</li>
      <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Friendships and hobbies shrinking because of time and energy demands.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section>
    <h2>2. Anticipatory Grief and After Loss</h2>
    <p>Carers often begin grieving long before death — a loved one with dementia may no longer recognise them, or a parent with terminal illness may no longer be the person they once knew. This is called <strong>anticipatory grief</strong>, and it can bring sadness, anger, and exhaustion.</p>
    <p>After loss, carers may feel “unmoored” — suddenly without the daily role that defined their days. It is common to feel relief and grief at the same time. Both are normal, human responses.</p>

        <span class="cap"><strong>Boundaries</strong><br>Say “yes” to what matters, “no” where possible. One small limit (like not answering non-urgent calls at night) protects your energy.</span>

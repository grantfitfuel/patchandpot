  <h1>Understanding Grief</h1>
  <p class="lead">Grief is not an illness — it’s a natural response to loss. It comes in many forms, and each person’s journey is unique. If you feel overwhelmed, you are not broken; you are human. This page explains the different types of grief, why they can feel so heavy, and where to find support.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Types of Grief</h2>
    <p>While everyone’s experience is personal, recognising the different shapes grief can take can help normalise what you feel:</p>

    <h3>1. Anticipatory grief</h3>
    <p>This begins before a death or loss occurs — for example, when a loved one has a terminal illness. It can bring waves of sadness, fear, and guilt, but it can also provide time to say goodbye and prepare.</p>

    <h3>2. Complicated grief</h3>
    <p>For some, grief does not ease with time. It may feel stuck, overwhelming, or consuming. This can happen after sudden or traumatic loss, or where the relationship carried conflict. Professional help may be especially important here.</p>

    <h3>3. Disenfranchised grief</h3>
    <p>Sometimes society doesn’t recognise a loss as “valid.” This might happen after miscarriage, suicide, loss of a pet, or the end of a relationship. The pain is real, but acknowledgement may be missing.</p>

    <h3>4. Collective grief</h3>
    <p>Communities can grieve together — after a natural disaster, violence, or a public figure’s death. These moments remind us of our shared humanity and vulnerability.</p>

    <h3>5. Secondary losses</h3>
    <p>Grief isn’t only about the person we lose. It can also mean grieving routines, roles, places, or a sense of identity tied to that person.</p>

    <h3>6. Childhood grief</h3>
    <p>Children grieve differently to adults. They may express grief through behaviour, play, or questions, rather than words. Gentle honesty and presence are vital.</p>

    <h2>Why Grief Feels Overwhelming</h2>
    <p>Grief affects both mind and body. You may experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waves of sadness, anger, guilt, or relief.</li>
      <li>Forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, or feeling detached.</li>
      <li>Physical exhaustion, changes in appetite or sleep.</li>
      <li>Anxiety and depression, which can magnify the pain and make daily tasks harder.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These responses are normal, but if they feel unmanageable, support is available.</p>

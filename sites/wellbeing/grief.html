  <h1>Understanding Grief</h1>
  <p class="lead">Grief is a natural but deeply personal process. It changes how we think, feel, and function. Everyone’s grief looks different, yet there are common patterns and challenges that many people share. This page explores the different types of grief, why they happen, and offers practical guidance and support resources available in the UK and Scotland.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 1: Types of Grief -->
  <section id="types-of-grief">
    <h2>Different forms of grief</h2>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Anticipatory grief</h3>
      <p>Grieving <strong>before the loss has occurred</strong>. Often experienced when a loved one faces terminal illness, dementia, or another progressive decline. Feelings may include sadness, dread, and even guilt for mourning “too soon.”</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A partner of someone with advanced cancer may mourn the conversations they will no longer share long before death occurs.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Hospice carer groups, peer networks, and preparing rituals (like letters or recordings) can help channel anticipatory grief.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Acute grief</h3>
      <p>The <strong>initial stage after a loss</strong>. Intense, raw, and overwhelming. People may feel disoriented, numb, angry, or unable to focus. It can manifest as exhaustion, disrupted sleep, or physical symptoms like chest tightness.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Forgetting daily tasks or expecting the person to walk back into the room are common responses.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Rely on routines and allow others to help with meals, childcare, and admin. Anchor yourself with grounding tools like slow breathing or holding a familiar object.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Complicated or prolonged grief</h3>
      <p>When grief <strong>remains disabling beyond 12 months</strong>. This can involve ongoing disbelief, inability to imagine life without the person, or extreme guilt that blocks healing. Also called <em>Prolonged Grief Disorder</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A bereaved spouse unable to enter the bedroom years later, or avoiding all reminders of their partner.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Access to structured grief therapy or charities such as <a href="https://www.crusescotland.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cruse Bereavement Support Scotland</a> can be vital.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Disenfranchised grief</h3>
      <p>This is grief that <strong>isn’t socially recognised</strong>. Losses like miscarriage, infertility, pet death, or estranged family members may not receive the same support, leaving people isolated.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A man mourning an ex-partner may be told “but you weren’t together anymore,” yet the pain is real.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Validation is key. Online communities, memorial rituals, or creative expression (planting a tree, keeping a memory journal) can help honour these losses.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Collective grief</h3>
      <p>Shared grief across communities or societies. Often triggered by disasters, pandemics, wars, or deaths of public figures. It can both connect and overwhelm individuals.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Collective mourning during the COVID-19 pandemic reignited personal grief for many people.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> Community vigils, remembrance services, or joining local support groups can foster belonging during these experiences.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 2: Why grief feels so heavy -->
  <section id="why">
    <h2>Why grief feels so heavy</h2>
    <p>Grief involves the whole body: disrupted sleep, low energy, poor concentration, changes in appetite, and emotional extremes. It is closely linked with anxiety and depression. These conditions often intensify grief’s weight, making it feel unending or impossible to manage.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> These responses are not signs of weakness — they are normal neurological and hormonal responses to loss.</p>

      <figcaption class="cap">Coping strategies work best in layers — combining rest, connection, expression, and support.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>1. Routines and anchors</h3>
      <p>Keeping meals, bedtimes, or walks consistent helps stabilise the body and brain when emotions feel chaotic.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>2. Connection</h3>
      <p>Talk about the person, share photos, or join a support group. Avoiding all reminders can prolong pain.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>3. Expression</h3>
      <p>Writing, gardening, art, or music can provide safe outlets for emotions that are difficult to speak.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>4. Movement</h3>
      <p>Light exercise such as walking or yoga lowers stress hormones and supports sleep.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>5. Support networks</h3>
      <p>Lean on friends and family, but also explore organisations that specialise in grief:</p>

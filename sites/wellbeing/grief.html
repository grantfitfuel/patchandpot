  <h1>Grief and Loss</h1>
  <p class="lead">Grief is not an illness to be “fixed.” It is a natural, painful process that changes us. Everyone grieves differently, but no one needs to grieve alone. This page explains why grief feels the way it does, explores different kinds of loss, and points you to practical help and support.</p>

  <section id="why-grief">
    <h2>Why grief feels so overwhelming</h2>
    <p>Grief is both <strong>emotional</strong> and <strong>physical</strong>. The brain processes loss as a form of danger: the person we depended on for connection, safety, or identity is gone. This triggers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shock:</strong> numbness or disbelief, even if the loss was expected.</li>
      <li><strong>Yearning:</strong> a deep ache, sometimes felt as pain in the chest.</li>
      <li><strong>Disorientation:</strong> days blending together, difficulty concentrating, memory lapses.</li>
      <li><strong>Waves of emotion:</strong> sadness, anger, guilt, relief — sometimes all in a single hour.</li>
      <li><strong>Body symptoms:</strong> fatigue, tight chest, shallow breathing, digestive upset, lowered immunity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depression and anxiety often intensify grief. You may feel <em>stuck</em> in low mood or constant fear. This does not mean you are weak — it is how the nervous system responds to trauma and absence.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="types-of-grief">
    <h2>Different kinds of grief</h2>
    <p>Grief is not “one size fits all.” Recognising the type can help you make sense of your reactions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anticipatory grief:</strong> mourning before death, common in dementia, cancer, and other illnesses.</li>
      <li><strong>Sudden loss:</strong> shock and disbelief may dominate; body and mind often feel numb.</li>
      <li><strong>Child loss:</strong> profoundly life-altering, with waves of guilt and injustice — “this should never happen.”</li>
      <li><strong>Suicide bereavement:</strong> uniquely complicated, often carrying shame, anger, unanswered questions, and stigma.</li>
      <li><strong>Complicated or prolonged grief:</strong> when daily life remains disrupted for a long time and emotions feel “stuck.”</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="coping">
    <h2>Ways to cope day-to-day</h2>
    <p>There is no timeline for grief, but small steps can help you live alongside it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Allow the waves:</strong> grief comes in bursts — letting them happen is healthier than suppressing.</li>
      <li><strong>Anchor in routine:</strong> regular meals, sleep times, and daily walks help stabilise your body and brain.</li>
      <li><strong>Breath and body:</strong> deep exhalations calm the nervous system; gentle movement (yoga, walking) reduces tension.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory rituals:</strong> lighting a candle, planting a flower, or keeping a journal of memories can be soothing.</li>
      <li><strong>Social scaffolding:</strong> reach out to friends or groups who understand; isolation magnifies grief.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional support:</strong> grief counselling or peer groups can normalise what feels overwhelming.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="when-to-seek-help">
    <h2>When to seek more support</h2>
    <p>Grief is natural, but if you experience any of the following, please seek support:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Persistent thoughts of not wanting to live.</li>
      <li>Inability to function in daily life for weeks at a time.</li>
      <li>Overwhelming guilt, self-blame, or worthlessness.</li>
      <li>Physical collapse from exhaustion, lack of eating or sleeping.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You do not need to wait until crisis point — speaking to a counsellor, GP, or calling a helpline can help much earlier.</p>
